# zip-extractor-with-path-fix
A Python tool for robustly extracting multiple ZIP files into named folders, automatically handling and shortening long file or folder names that would otherwise fail extraction on Windows due to path length limits. Skips, truncates, and warns about problematic filenaming, making it perfect for backup, archiving, and shared drives.
